🚀 Just Built: A GenAI-powered PDF AI Assistant! 🧠📄

Tired of manually reading through lengthy PDFs just to get a quick overview or extract information?
I’ve developed a PDF AI Assistant that brings intelligence to your documents — built using Streamlit, LangChain, Ollama (LLaMA3), and FAISS for offline vector search.

🧰 Features at a glance:

	•	📎 Split PDFs into pages for granular access.
	•	🔄 Merge multiple PDFs with preview and reordering.
	•	🧠 Chat with documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
	•	📤 Export to Word, PPTX, and Summary PDFs in one click.
	•	💡 Supports offline embeddings with nomic-embed-text for full privacy.

👨‍💻 Built for:
	•	Researchers 📚

	•	Product & Sales enablement 📈
	•	Anyone who handles tons of PDFs!

🔗 Open source & privacy-friendly — runs fully on your local machine.
